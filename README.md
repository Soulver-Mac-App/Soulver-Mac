## 📊 Overview  

Soulver is an innovative hybrid tool that blends the simplicity of a text editor with the power of a numerical calculator. Instead of forcing users into traditional formula structures, Soulver allows you to write out calculations naturally—similar to jotting down notes—while instantly generating accurate results. This makes it especially valuable for quick calculations, budgeting, planning scenarios, or situations where numbers evolve during the thought process.

Each line functions as its own independent calculation, helping keep complex numerical thinking organized and easy to follow. You can adjust values, add new lines, or reference previous results without breaking the flow. This structure is perfect for tasks like cost projections, invoices, travel planning, percentage breakdowns, or any workflow that requires flexible numeric exploration.

The engine behind Soulver understands plain-language commands, unit conversions, percentages, variables, and even date calculations. It automatically interprets text, detects values, and formats expressions cleanly. With support for currencies, time spans, measurements, and mathematical operators, it becomes a powerful everyday companion for anyone handling numbers regularly.

Soulver also brings organization to multi-step calculations through sheets, bookmarks, and categorized notes. Its minimalist interface focuses on clarity, allowing users to quickly scan through results without clutter. Syncing across devices ensures that calculations stay accessible whether you're at your desk or on the go.

Designed for students, analysts, developers, freelancers, and everyday thinkers, Soulver replaces rigid spreadsheets and basic calculators with a more intuitive, free-form approach to math—turning numeric reasoning into a streamlined, creative process.
